# Sudoku
Sudoku game that leverages a Sudoku Solver to check the proposed solution

***NOTE***: **grid submission is quite naive, as it simply compares the content of each cell to the corresponding cell of the solution obtained by the solver.**

**This means that if the grid has more than a single solution (hopefully it doesn't), grid submission only accepts the solution reached by the solver, thus discarding any other possible solution**
